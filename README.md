# Exploratory Data Analysis w Python
#### This portfolio collects multiple Python based data analysis projects that explore real datasets using pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Each folder contains its own notebook, dataset, and insights. The goal of this portfolio is to show clear, structured analysis and demonstrate growing skills in exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data driven reasoning.

#### This repository shows my ongoing progress in Python data analysis. Each project reflects a different type of dataset and demonstrates core analysis skills that support my path toward data science and future graduate studies.
